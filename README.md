# Demo NewsGrid Website Miniproject

This is a simple miniproject I'm doing following a course on HTML & CSS ( [Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) by Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-html-css-from-the-beginning/) ).

In order to improve and make a bit more interesting this miniproject I decided to add a little challenge to myself, that is to implement the project using ReactJs (which I'm currently studying).

For the first of the course's minitprojects ( [Demo Hotel Website Miniproject](https://github.com/dario-piotrowicz/ReactJS-CSS_demo_hotel_website_miniproject) ) the challenge was not to use the Create-React-App tool, JSX, Babel, Webpack, etc... (just plain HTML, CSS and Javascript), in the next one ( [Demo Fictional Company Website Miniproject](https://github.com/dario-piotrowicz/ReactJS-SCSS_demo_fictional-company_website_miniproject) ) the challenge was to setup the whole react application up by myself and configuring manually webpack and babel.
\
\
In this project I am besically doing the same but I am also adding Typescript to the mix (which gives me a good opportunity to use react with typescript a pattern I have seen being used online).

\
Most of the UI designs and HTML/CSS are taken from the course, so that is not designed by me, what is 100% completely mine is the files structure, the aforementioned configration and the react aspects.
